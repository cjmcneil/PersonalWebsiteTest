        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Colin McNeil!</p>
        <p> 
            I am a Computer Science Master's Student at UNC-Charlotte, 
            focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
            This past summer, I had a terrific internship with TIAA, 
            and after graduating in May 2023, I will be working with them again
            as a rotational associate!
        </p>
        <p> 
            Beyond academia, I enjoy watching movies, listening to movie soundtracks, and even writing movies!
            My personal dream is to be a screenwriter and filmmaker someday.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Here at UNC-Charlotte, you can find usually find me at Atkins Library
            or at Saint Thomas Aquinas Church across the street from campus. 
            I've been here since 2020 and I'd be glad to show you around!
